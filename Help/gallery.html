<h2>Edition</h2>
<p>In edition mode (tap 'Edit' button in navigation bar), you can manage all your groups and paintings, such as rename and delete.</p>
<p>You can also share and move paintings as you wanted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share:&nbsp;
<p>A Painting can be shared with standard 'Share' actions of iPad in edition mode.</p></li>
<li>Move:<br />A Painting can be moved freely if and only if they are sorted with 'Group'.</li></ul>
<h2>Import</h2>
<p>This feature imports an exported Painting in its own format from Sharing folder of this App.</p>
<p>You have two ways to import it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using the Import feature of Gallery, but firstly, you need to drag and drop your painting files with its own format to sharing folder by using iTunes.</li>
<li>Using 'Open with' action of iPad, when you tap a painting file with its own format or even a picture, there should be a popup window, just select 'Import with Impasto' to import and open it with this App. For example open it in an email.</li></ol>
<h2>Export</h2>
<p>A Painting can be exported in a special format to contain all information such as Tools, wet state, thickness, etc. It can be done using the Export button in Gallery to create a file in the Sharing folder.</p>
<p>And then you can download them using iTunes.</p>
<p>Since exported files are saved in Sharing Folder of our App, you may need to clean up from time to time in the Setting panel of Impasto.</p>

<ul>
<li>Title: Sort all paintings with their title names.</li>
