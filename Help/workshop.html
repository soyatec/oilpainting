<h2>Painting Tools</h2>
<p>A painting tool is used to produce the artwork directly. During the painting process, a painting tool may have different states. For example, Knife and Brush has three states: Clean, Dirty, Pattern.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>State</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th colspan="1">Transition</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Clean</td>
<td>Tool has a non color</td>
<td colspan="1">
<p>A Clean tool becomes Dirty when we use it to paint to interact with the colors on surface.</p>
<p>If the option Auto Reset is enabled, this action cleans the current saved pattern. In this case, the tool has the same effect as the option Auto Clean.</p></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Dirty</td>
<td>Tool has kept some colors produced during the painting process.</td>
<td colspan="1">
<p>A Dirty tool can be back to Clean by the button Clean. If the option Auto Reset is disabled, a Dirty tool keeps dirty between strokes.</p>
<p>If the option Auto Reset is enabled, it comes back to Pattern state after each stroke. if a Pattern state has no color, it is in Clean state.</p>
<p>The temporary Dirty state can be saved as a Pattern to be reused easily afterhands.</p></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Pattern</td>
<td>Tool has some colors and</td>
<td colspan="1">
<p>The tool like Brush and Knife may become Dirty when it <span>interacts with the colors on surface. <span>The state is known as color pattern. This state can be saved and then reused repeatedly by the option Auto Reset. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This state goes back to Clean by the button, Clean.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The Tube Tool is simplest painting tool since it has no bi-directional interaction with canvas. The purpose of Tube is enabled to put some color liquid on canvas. Therefore, the options Auto Reset and Auto Clean don't make sense for Tube.</p>
<p>The option Auto Reset is a property of Painting Tool.<span> <span>The change on these options is applied to the current Painting Tool. And t</span></span>he both options cannot be used together. Only one of them can be enabled.</p>
<p>When the option Auto Reset is enabled, the pattern is saved on the following cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pickup action over <span>the Color bowl</span></li>
<li><span>Using Pickup tool</span></li>
<li>Clean action</li></ol>
<h3>Color Tubes</h3>
<p>Color Tube contains color liquid. It is used to add some color liquid on the support directly. The pressure of Apple Pencil controls the quantity of color: more pressure, bigger diameter of color liquid on canvas. The direction of Altitude and Azimuth has no effect.</p>
<h3>Brushes</h3>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Brushes are the most important part of your equipment. Brushes come in different shapes, t<span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">he most common shapes brushes come in are: Flats, Filberts, Fans and Mops</span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">. The detail of each is described in the following paragraphs. </span></span></p>
<p>All these Brushes have a common behaviour and control. Comparing to Knifes, Brushes leaves always Bristle traces in strokes, and bristles of Brush spread slightly on the pressure you applied to painting support. Same as Knife, the pressure plays an important role on the thickness of wet color layer. The thickness is inverse-proportional to the pressure: more pressure, thinner of the layer.</p>

<h4>Filbert</h4>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">A Filbert looks like a Flat with the corners rounded. The stroke is oval shaped or half circular. They are used when you want a softer edge or for smaller blends than you get with a Flat. <span style="color: rgb(25,25,25);">Because of its distinctive, semi-circular shape, a fan brush can easily create a series of marks in your painting that are repetitive and predictable. </span></span></p>

<h3>Knifes</h3>
<p><span style="color: rgb(25,25,25);">Painting with a knife produces quite a different result to a brush. They are excellent for&nbsp;producing a range of effects, from textured impasto work </span><span style="color: rgb(25,25,25);">to sweeping areas of flat color, even tiny shapes of color. </span>Different shaped painting knives obviously produce different effects.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>A short blade produces angular strokes</span></li>
<li>A long blade makes it easy to put down sweeps of color.</li>
<li>A sharp-pointed blade will allow you to scratch into the paint for sgraffito effects&nbsp;.</li></ul>
<p>Useless to say that Knifes are one of the most used paint tools by artists.</p>
<p><img height="250" src="../images/Knife1.jpg" /><img height="250" src="../images/Knife5.jpg" /><img height="250" src="../images/Knife2.jpg" /><img height="250" src="../images/Knife4.jpg" /><img height="250" src="../images/Knife3.jpg" /></p>
<p>With our application, a knife can be controlled by Apple Pencil as following:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Apple Pencil</th>
<th>Description of Knife</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Pressure</td>
<td>
<p>Control the thickness of color. More pressure, thinner of color layer on painting support. Pressure on knife can effect neither on the size of the Knife, non on the Knife form.</p></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Altitude</td>
<td><span>Control Knife's vertical direction. The knife lays totally on the </span>surface when the Altitude Angle is less than 30&deg;. The vertical angle is controlled by the Altitude of Apple Pencil between 30&deg; and 90&deg;.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Azimuth</td>
<td><span>Control the knife orientation in the plan of painting support. </span></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>A rotation of Knife on it axis provides a lot of capabilities. Unfortunately, Apple Pencil doesn't provide this information. Same as Brush, the rotation is controlled by a UI Widget named as Joystick.</p>
<h4>Knife Painting</h4>
<p>General Speaking, a Knife has two roles in Painting: blending color and removing color. It depends on direction, orientation and rotation of Knife.</p>
<p>When the Knife has a rotation, that means the Knife has an angle with the paint surface, the motion direction of Knife has different painting effect. The Knife moves to the direction of angle &lt; 90, it is in Blending mode, known as Forward Painting. When it moves to opposite direction (angle &gt; 90), it is a Cleaning mode, known as Backward Painting. In this mode, the quantity of the liquid on the surface will decrease.</p>
<p><img height="250" src="../images/KNife-Painting.png" /></p>
<p>In the following screen shot, the rotation of the Knife is 45&deg;. Moving to left is in Cleaning node. Moving to right is in normal Painting mode.</p>
<p><img width="563" src="../images/ForwardBackwordKnife.jpg" /></p>
<h4>Sgraffito Effect</h4>
<p>In<span> Cleaning mode, w</span>hen a knife stands up near to 90* or rotate near to 90&deg; or - 90&deg;, it produces the <strong>Sgraffito</strong> effects. The effects are pressure sensitive.</p>

<h4>Pick Up Gesture</h4>
<p>In general, when we paint slowly, most of color will leave on the surface. But some time, we need to pick up the color from painting surface. Typically, it is the purpose of Palette. A gesture is provided to meet this need. This gesture consists of the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select a more thick color region</li>
<li>Press you knife hardly on paint surface</li>
<li>And then, rise it up very quickly</li></ol>
<p>It performs like a Tap. The most important is to leave the surface as quickly as possible.</p>
<h3>Chamois Leathers</h3>
<p>Chamois Leather is excellent when a soft finish is required. The Chamois is an ideal tool for cleaning paper surfaces and dip pen nibs, also offers protection when changing 'needle pointed' nibs.</p>
<h3>Towel</h3>

<h3>Tortillion</h3>
<h2>Utility Tools</h2>
<h3>Color Filling</h3>
<p>This tool is used to select a Color on painting support. It isn't a really Painting tool. It simulates the action to fill <span>the current painting tool with </span>Color such as Tube, Knife, Brush, etc. This action is similar as you dip your painting tool in color liquid.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Drawing Tool</th>
<th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Tube</td>
<td>
<p>Select a color of tube</p>
<p>The <span>quantity of filling is independent of pressure <span>of Apple Pencil when you click on Painting support or color icon. It is maximum. </span></span></p></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Knife</td>
<td>
<p>Select a color and fill the current knife with this color liquid.</p>

<p>When you select the Color Picker, the current drawing tool gets disabled. It will be enabled after the selection operation.</p>
<p>The color selected is a pure color without any light and <span>shadow influence by the 3D display engine</span>.</p>
<h3>Color Pattern Picker</h3>
<p>This tool selects a color pattern using the Pickup Gesture. The current painting tool gets clean before the color pattern pickup.</p>

<h3>Dryer</h3>
<p>Dryer is a utility to control the dry state of color on canvas. You can use it make some regions dry. When you click on this tool, the current canvas will be overlaid by a layer. The wet region is displayed in white semi-transparent layer. The dried region is totally opaque and white. You can place the dryer anywhere to change it.</p>
<p>Once it is done, this <span>dried</span> region becomes rigid surface: the color in this region can be changed: neither be blended, non be removed.</p>
<p>The dryness of color can give some special effect with Knifes. You can remove the wet colors in erase mode to show the color under layer.</p>
<p>This tool can be used only on the canvas. It cannot be used on Palettes.</p>
<h3><span style="color: rgb(37,35,35);">Wetter</span></h3>
<p>The user interface of this tool is similar to Dryer. When you click on this tool, the current canvas will be overlaid by a thin layer. The wetness is displayed in black semi-transparent color. The degree of black represents wetness.</p>
<h3>Turpentine</h3>
<p><span style="color: rgb(37,35,35);">This tool is used to dilute colors to thinner the layer and spread the liquid. It modifies the Wetness of color on Painting support.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-size: 20.0px;font-weight: normal;">Palette</span></h3>
<p>Palette is an extension of main Canvas. We use it to prepare colors and patterns of Painting Tools. It<span> shares Painting tools with main Canvas.</span></p>
<h3>Automatic Save</h3>
<p>There are two parameters in this App to enable the Automatic Save. One parameter is to enable/disable this feature. Another is to set the interval of each save.</p>
<p>In the editor, if this feature is enabled and after the each stroke, a timer is created with the interval parameter defined in the App. The action of save will be invoked after the interval time.</p>
<h3><span>Sharing, Import &amp; Export</span></h3>
<p><span>A painting can be Imported and exported from/to image</span> in png format.</p>
<h4><span>Import</span></h4>
<p><span>There are two mechanisms to import an Image:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>From a Workshop, an image can be imported on top of the current Painting content. The content before the import will be put in Dry.</li>
<li>From outside of Impasto such as App Photo, you can select an image and then creates a new Painting in the same size of imported image and imports the image. In fact, the import consists of two steps:
<ul>
<li>Create a temporary file in a shared folder</li>
<li>Create an Painting inside of Impasto, which can occurs on the startup or in the Gallery when you scroll.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>Please note that when you import a lot of images, the next startup of Impasto can be slow down.</p>
<h4><span>Export</span></h4>
<p><span>Inside of Workshop, the button &quot;Export&quot; converts the current Painting only in Image and then saves it in Photo Library. </span></p>
<h4><span>Share</span></h4>
<p>This feature <span>converts the current Painting in Image <span>and then publishes it in any social network you have such as </span></span>Facebook, WeChart etc.</p>
<h2>Undo/Redo</h2>
<p>Due to the limitation on memory of IPad, the only 20 undo/redo operations is supported. If you can more undo operations, you need to use the Timeline to go back to anytime.</p>
<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The Timeline shows all your artworks through the time axis. You can select any time to go back. When you go back to a past time and modify it, the following operations will be lost.</p>
