	<p>Traditional software works with color in ways that are faithful
		to the way machines display color, which is based on light emission.
		The colour of dyes and pigments is based on light absorption.</p>
	<p>The blend of light emission is different to the one of light
		absorption for some colors.</p>
	<p>For example, with light emission, Yellow blended with Blue
		produces Gray. But it is Green in Light absorption.</p>
	<p>
		Therefore, use of light emission system for Painting not only
		unintuitive to users, but also gives a wrong result in gradient. More
		details can be found in <a href="color_management.html">Color
			Management</a>.
