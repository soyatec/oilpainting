		Tool Controller is additional controller for <a
			href="painting_tools.html">Painting Tools</a>, as you know, the <strong>Azimuth</strong>
		and <strong>Altitude</strong> of a <a href="painting_tools.html">Painting
			Tools</a> can be controlled by the <a href="prerequisites.html">Apple
			Pencil</a> easily, but the <strong>Rotation</strong> of it can not be
		controlled by the <a href="prerequisites.html">Apple Pencil</a> now.
	</p>
	<p>
		So we introduced the Tool Controller to control the <strong>Rotation</strong>
		of <a href="painting_tools.html">Painting Tools</a>.
	</p>
	<h2>Controller</h2>

	<p>Drag on the metallic ball of it, you will find the snapshot of
		the painting tools(Brushes and Knifes) will be rotated.</p>
	<p>Of course, the stroke lines of painting tools(Brushes and
		Knifes) will be different if this value is different.</p>
