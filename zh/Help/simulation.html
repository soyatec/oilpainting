	<p>The goal of this application is to simulate as closely as
		possible to the real Oil Painting. Precisely, the simulation consists
		of the following aspects:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Painting Process</li>
		<li>Painting Tools</li>
		<li>Color Management</li>
		<li>Liquid</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Painting Process</h2>
	<p>
		This application simulates as closely as possible to the real Painting
		approach. It provides not only a Palette for Color preparation, but
		also a capability to produce painting strokes very hard to repeat.
		Under the same conditions, all strokes made by users are very similar,
		but never the same. They aren't closed <span>mechanically.</span>
	</p>
	<h2>Painting Tool</h2>
	<p>Most of Oil Painting tools are supported such as Brush, Knife
	  and Fluffy Mop. Please read <a href="painting_tools.html">here</a> to get more details.</p>
	<h2>Color Management</h2>
	<p>Color is very important in Oil Painting, this application simulates the real color process in the
	  Painting process. Please read <a href="color_management.html">here</a> to get more details.</p>
	<h2>Liquid</h2>
	<p>In the real physic world, the density of Color plays an
		important role on Painting. It influences the thickness of layer and
		capability of color spreading and blending. More density of liquid can
		produce easier the effect Impasto, and thinner liquid can give an
		effect of water or cloud.</p>
	<p>This application simulates the medium like Turpentine. In the
		real Oil Painting, Turpentine is a thinner, it will make the painting
		look more like water-color, depending on the quantities and it makes
		it opaque.</p>
	<p>
		The <span>simulation of </span>Color Liquid consists of a Color
		management in two states: Dried and Wet. Color Liquid in Dried is in
		fact a liquid anymore, it is a solid state. It doesn't participate the
		color <span>blending</span> in painting. However, <span>Color
			Liquid in Wet is managed by a property named as Wetness, which is
			used to control the density of Color Liquid. A Wet Color can become
			Dried via a tool Dryer, which shows d<span>ryness state of
				entier Artwork in a dedicated view.</span> But the Dried liquid can never
			come back to Wet. The Wetness is controlled by the tools Turpentine,
			Fluffy Mop and Wetter. The last shows Wetness of entier Artwork in a
			<span>dedicated</span> view.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p>The simulation of Wetness consumes a lot of iPad processors.
		With a important value of Wetness, the response time of Apple Pencil
		will be impacted. In worst time, it increases by a factor of 2. But it
		is still acceptable.</p>
